		<p class="description">This size makes it easier for developers to use your Photoshop, Sketch, or Illustrator source file as a measurement spec, because it matches the density independent (DIP) grid: an abstract pixel grid used by apps and browsers to approximate consistent sizing across displays of varying pixel densities.</p>

		<h2 class="title">Bitmap asset scale for<br><span class="dip-res"></span> comp</h2>
		<p class="more">More</p>
		<p class="description">Bitmap assets, including photos and other non-vector elements, should be cut for developers at <span class="density"></span> times the size they appear in your <span class="dip-res"></span> comp. For example, a 100 &times; 100 image in your comp would need to be cut as a <span class="asset-res"></span> &times; <span class="asset-res"></span> asset. If you use Photoshop for your screen comp, it might be helpful to link your high resolution bitmap assets as smart objects.</p>

		<h2 class="title">Practical screen comp size for<br>Photoshop Retina and prototyping</h2>
		<p class="more">More</p>
		<p class="description">If you use Photoshop with a Retina display and you find <span class="dip-res"></span> too small as a design space, use <span class="display-res"></span> instead. This is also a practical comp size if you plan to do a lot of screen-based prototyping with tools like InVision. As a best practice, append @<span class="density"></span>x to the PSD filename so that both designers and developers know they should divide by <span class="density"></span> to get proper DIP measurements.
